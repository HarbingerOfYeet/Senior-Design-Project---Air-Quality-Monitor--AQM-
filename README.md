# Senior Design Project Fall 2023 - Air Quality Monitor (AQM)

The purpose of this project is to create a low-cost, portable air quality monitor for individuals to monitor
levels of formaldehyde and particulate matter (PM) in the air. The two sensors in the device are the Sensiron
SFA30-D-T to detect formaldehyde, and the Honeywell HPMA115CO-004 to detect PM. The SFA30-D-T also has temperature
and humidity sensing capabilities. The user will be alerted to rising and dangerous concentrations of formaldehyde
and PM in the air via vibration, sound, and smartphone notification.

This repository contains the firmware code necessary to operate the device.
